3)Dynamic Programming


Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Deepak Sivaraman
Alogrithm Analysis
Understanding different Algorithms available and how they can be used for implementation of models for AI/ML. This should also give an understanding on how to train models with higher
accuracy to help with modelling. Before getting to Algorithm also need to ensure that we are aware of Mathematical concepts to help better design
